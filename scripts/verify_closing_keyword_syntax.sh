# Shared, byte-identical with EDS's copy of this script (both repos hit
# the same GitHub closing-keyword bug this session) -- keep them in sync
# if either changes.
#
# PURPOSE: Catch invalid GitHub issue-closing references BEFORE merge,
#          mechanically -- not by an agent or human remembering to check.
#
#          GitHub's auto-close keyword parser (close(s|d)/fix(es|ed)/
#          resolve(s|d)) only recognizes two reference forms: bare `#123`
#          (same-repo) or `owner/repo#123` (cross-repo). `EDS#123` (repo
#          name, no owner, directly before `#`) matches neither -- it is
#          not malformed enough to error or warn, it just silently isn't
#          recognized as an issue reference at all. Four issues went
#          unclosed this way in one PR with zero signal anything was
#          wrong (xaloqi-knowledge lessons/run-030); the documented
#          mitigation ("remember the correct syntax") demonstrably failed
#          to prevent an immediate recurrence in the very next PR
#          (lessons/run-031's sibling note). This script is the actual
#          fix: a mechanical, unconditional gate, not a reminder.
#
# USAGE:
#   bash scripts/verify_closing_keyword_syntax.sh [base-ref]
#
#   base-ref defaults to origin/main. Checks every commit in
#   base-ref..HEAD. In CI, the checkout must have enough history to reach
#   base-ref (fetch-depth: 0, or at least deep enough to cover the PR).
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0  No repo-prefixed closing-keyword references found.
#   1  At least one commit uses the invalid REPO#N form.
# =============================================================================
